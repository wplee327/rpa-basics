# What is RPA?
- RPA stands for **R**obotic **P**rocess **A**utomation.
- It is a business process automation technology using bots to perform repetitive, high-volume tasks that are rule-based and trigger-driven.
    - The purpose of this technology is to accomplish several goals:
        - Reduce time spent on simple and repetitive tasks to streamline workflow, increase productivity, and reduce overhead.
        - Prevent errors caused by human involvment, reducing time spent making corrections and improving compliance.
        - Allow workforce to focus on more complex and meaningful tasks.

## The RPA Life Cycle
![RPA Life Cycle](https://www.blueprintsys.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RPA-Lifecycle-Management-Blueprint.png?width=500&name=RPA-Lifecycle-Management-Blueprint.png)
1. **RPA Candidate Identification**  
The first stage involves identifying business processes and tasks that are good candidates for automation.
2. **Assessment & Prioritization**  
This stage requires stakeholders to assess the processes and tasks from the previous stage based on technical feasibility and business value/ROI (Return On Investment). Candidates that pass this stage are then ordered by priority and passed to the next stage.
3. **Design**  
This stage is where solutions for automating candidate processes and tasks are defined and modeled. Any additional dependencies such as the RPA platform are also identified at this stage. A blueprint for the solution is created at the end of this stage to be presented to the development team.
4. **Development**  
In this stage, a development team builds the bot based on the blueprint from the design stage. The development is performed in the studio environment provided by the chosen RPA platform.
5. **Testing**  
At this stage, the development team or a separate QA/QC (quality assurance/quality control) team tests the bot in a test or sandbox environment to ensure it works as intended and to identify any possible edge cases missed throughout the previous two stages.
6. **Deployment**  
When the team(s) involved in the testing stage are satisfied that the solution is robust and stable enough, it is deployed into production.
7. **Monitoring & Change Management**  
As with all software development, the last stage involves monitoring the solution for errors and to ensure it meets any defined performance targets as well as maintaining the bot to ensure any external changes from any dependencies does not affect the bot's ability to perform its tasks.
